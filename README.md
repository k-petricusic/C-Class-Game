If you're in the root of C-Class-Game, then do:

and then after that put the mode you want, it defaults to debug.

Examples:
./build.sh Debug
./build.sh Release

To run the game, do:
./build/game
Do this only after the first build command

Just run
./build.sh

or if you created new files (through reading CMakeLists)
